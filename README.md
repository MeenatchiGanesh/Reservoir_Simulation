# Reservoir_Simulation
It solves the complex two-phase (oil and gas) problems within a heterogeneous grid framework. Used implicit numerical methods to handle both pressure and transmissibility equations. Used Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) iterative solver to solve linear systems of equations from discretized reservoir equations
